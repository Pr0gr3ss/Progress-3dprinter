# Progress-3dprinter
Mendel Prusa i3 evolution

This is my take on the 3d printer.

I have built a box frame and have struggled with both the build and the perfomance. I have a few ideas that I would like to implement to try to relieve the issues I have found.

My thoughts initially are to make a different frame, enlarge the footprint, use a single z axis motor, design a open license hot end and use threadless ball screws for all axis. 
Well that is the beginning.
I am hopeful that in at least starting here, it may come to be.

So som progress on the basic ideas. 
I am continuing to find it difficult to source metric sizes for most everything. I can order, but very little selection local. So if I am to use what is locally available, I'll need to use SAE. It really should'nt be much of a change, but it makes it weird. (More thought needed on that.)
So what I found was steel angle with holes evenly spaced. This is lightweight, cheap, and easily cut and can be assembled quickly and is easy to keep square. I really dislike the complexity of the threaded rod for the base of the reprap, so making a square frame out of angle iron would be easy and reduce complexity. 
By using threadless ball screws, I can also eliminate the need for the rest of the threaded rod. If I am able to use lower quality standard rods, as opposed to ground and polished, then it would mean that all the axis could run on that. 
My thought is to use 3 rods for the bed. two would hold the bearings and the 3rd would be the diven. 
For the z axis, I would rather use one motor, so I plan on driving it from below. Using pinion gears at the base on both sides, I could use a gear to drive a shaft connected to both. This would take the weight off the motor, and one motor should be sufficient to  mover the carriage up. To help with this, I think that a simple counter weight system would be helpful. I am just not sure of the amount of vibration this might cause.
with the x axis, I think what the prusa is now will work by simply replacing the belt with a rod. I doubt that the dimentions would really need to change much. That would eliminate the need to redesign everything. 
On the electronic bits, I am leaning towards using Rumba or Rambo, Not sure, but I think it is a good direction to move.
