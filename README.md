# Progress-3dprinter
Mendel Prusa i3 evolution

This is my take on the 3d printer.

I have built a box frame and have struggled with both the build and the perfomance. I have a few ideas that I would like to implement to try to relieve the issues I have found.

My thoughts initially are to make a different frame, enlarge the footprint, use a single z axis motor, design a open license hot end and use threadless ball screws for all axis. 
Well that is the beginning.
I am hopeful that in at least starting here, it may come to be.
